# Attributes

Currently, there is no manually documented list of attributes. Still you can figure out what attributes are supported:

- You can look at the [`OpenApiAttributes`](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/src/Attributes) namespaces in the source.
- There also are some [examples](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples) which might help you out.
