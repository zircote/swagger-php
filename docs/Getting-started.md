# Getting started

The goal of swagger-php is the generate a swagger.json using phpdoc annotations.

To output:

```json
{
   "swagger": "2.0",
   "schemes": ["http"],
   "host": "example.com",
   "basePath": "/api"
}
```

Write:

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Swagger(
 *   schemes={"http"},
 *   host="example.com",
 *   basePath="/api"
 * )
 */
```

Note that Doctrine annotation supports arrays, but uses the `{` and `}` instead of `[` and `]`.

And although doctrine also supports objects, but also uses `{` and `}` and requires the properties to be surrounded with `"`.

DON'T write:

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Swagger(
 *   info={
 *     "title"="My first swagger documented API",
 *     "version"="1.0.0"
 *   }
 * )
 */
```

But use the annotation with the same name as the property, such as `@SWG\Info` for `info`:

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Swagger(
 *   @SWG\Info(
 *     title="My first swagger documented API",
 *     version="1.0.0"
 *   )
 * )
 */
```

This adds validation, so when you misspell a property or forget a required property it will trigger a php warning.  
For example the snippet above would generate a notice with "Unexpected field "titel" for @SWG\Info(), expecting "title", ..."

## Using variables in annotations

You can use constants inside doctrine annotations.

```php
define("API_HOST", ($env === "production") ? "example.com" : "localhost");
```

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Swagger(host=API_HOST)
 */
```

When you're using the CLI you'll need to include the php file with the constants using the `--bootstrap` options:
```
$ swagger --bootstrap constants.php
```


## Annotation placement

You shouldn't place all annotations inside one big @SWG\Swagger() annotation block, but scatter them throughout your codebase.
swagger-php will scan your project and merge all annotations into one @SWG\Swagger annotation.

The big benefit swagger-php provides is that the documentation lives close the the code implementing the api.

### Arrays and Objects

Placing multiple annotation of the same type will result in an array or object.
For objects, the convension for properties, is to use the same field name as the annotation: `response` in a `@SWG\Response`, `property` in a `@SWG\Property`, etc.

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Get(
 *   path="/products",
 *   summary="list products",
 *   @SWG\Response(
 *     response=200,
 *     description="A list with products"
 *   ),
 *   @SWG\Response(
 *     response="default",
 *     description="an ""unexpected"" error"
 *   )
 * )
 */
```

Generates:

```json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "paths": {
    "/products": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "list products",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "A list with products"
          },
          "default": {
            "description": "unexpected error"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "definitions": []
}
```

### Swagger-PHP detects values based on context

swagger-php looks at context of the comment which reduces duplication.

```php
/**
 * @SWG\Definition()
 */
class Product {

    /**
     * The product name
     * @var string
     * @SWG\Property()
     */
    public $name;
}
```

results in:

```json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "definitions": {
    "Product": {
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The product name"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As if you'd written:

```php

    /**
     * The product name
     * @var string
     *
     * @SWG\Property(
     *   property="name",
     *   type="string",
     *   descriptions="The product name" 
     * )
     */
    public $name;
```
