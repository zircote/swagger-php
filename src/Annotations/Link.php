 * The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response.

 * relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OA linking mechanism does not require
 * link information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime expression is used for
 * accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
