 * A "Link Object" https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#link-object
 *
 * The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response.
 * The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.
 * Unlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OA linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime expression is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
